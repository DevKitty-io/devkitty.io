## Tools

### ESPTool
ESPTool is the official tool for managing Espressif chips.  It can identify boards, modify flash space, and more!

##### Install ESPTool
```
pip3 install esptool.py
```

##### Create a Binary
After developing and writing custom firmware to the ESP32, you may wish to extract a fullsize binary that contains your application, and perhaps files on the flash space.  

This is how our ScriptKitty Binary includes default examples in the flash drive.

```bash
esptool.py read_flash 0 0x400000 <vx.x_binary_ddmmyy>.bin
```

##### Flash a Binary
We suggest using ESPtool for writing binaries, but our [web flasher](https://update.devkitty.io) is more accessible for beginners.
```bash
esptool.py write_flash 0 <vx.x_binary_ddmmyy>.bin
```

## Documentation
Our documentation is written in Markdown, and rendered as a static site using [Hugo]() with the [Doks Theme]().  The source code is [hosted on our GitHub](), and new updates are automatically rendered & hosted on [GitHub pages]().

This makes it really easy for anyone to contribute a pull request!
