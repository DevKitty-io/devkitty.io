DevKitty can be flashed to act as a SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) device, connecting to a Wi-Fi network appearing to nearby Windows users as a network-attached drive.
<br /> <br />

This attack can be used to redirect users to phishing pages when they click on the drive. We created a demo you can find [here](https://github.com/DevKitty.io)
<br /><br />
You can check out the guide below to try the attack yourself:
