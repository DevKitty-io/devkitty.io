**ScriptKitty is a cat-themed keystroke injection tool** that lets you select hundreds of payloads using the on-screen interface - or even deploy attacks remotely via a WiFi interface!

Run and edit payloads over Wi-Fi from mobile and desktop devices, or use the quick-select menu to launch payloads at the press of a button. Watch each command execute in real time on the built-in screen, and get instant feedback on your attack from the built-in LED.

The DevKitty mounts as a USB flash drive when plugged into your computer, making it easy to drag and drop multiple payloads to the onboard storage!
