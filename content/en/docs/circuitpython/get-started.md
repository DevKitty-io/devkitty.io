## Why CircuitPython?
[Adafruit Circuitpython]() is a beginner-friendly language that runs directly on microcontrollers.  This means instead of compiling & uploading code from your computer, you can run code directly on your DevKitty!

This makes CircuitPython a suitable choice for rapid prototyping & coding on-the-go.  You can write code from any computer, or even a phone without installing any custom tools.

## Installation
[CircuitPython.org]() provides support for a large array of boards. DevKitty is based around the S2 Mini Microcontroller, so download this [appropriate `.bin` file](https://circuitpython.org/board/lolin_s2_mini/).

Follow our [flasher guide]() to update your DevKitty!  This will overwrite any code you have installed.

## How it Works
With CircuitPython flashed to your DevKitty, you're ready to code from anywhere.  All you need is a device with a Serial connection!

In short, CircuitPython creates a mini "flash drive" on your DevKitty, where it stores source code files:
- `setup.py` - "bootloader code" that runs when turned on
- `main.py` - where your main source code lives
