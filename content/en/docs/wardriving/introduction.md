## What is Wardriving?
[Wardriving]() is a reconaissance technique that involves driving around while scanning for wireless devices.  It's one of the quickest ways to gather intelligence on large amounts of WiFi networks and devices!  

Typically, all you need is a WiFi & GPS enabled device (like a smartphone), but you can get started for as cheap as $10 using microcontrollers.  We're basically just "geotagging" the wireless devices, so we can locate them later on.

<!-- ## Potential Use Cases
There's a wide variety of use cases for Wardriving, but its most often used to collect vulnerable networks & devices, or for 
- Data Visualization
- Hunting vulnerable IoT Devices
