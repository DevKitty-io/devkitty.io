## What is Kismet?
[Kismet]() is a popular wardriving & wireless recon tool that lets you sniff WiFi, Bluetooth, Cellular, and other protocols in a streamlined web app!  When you're ready to take your wardriving skills to the next level, we recommend trying out this project.

This is an example of Kismet in action in one of Alex's old videos!

## DevKitty Kismet Interface
You can use your DevKitty board as a Kismet Interface!  Thanks to Kismet [Scan Mode](), we can report basic WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS telemetry to the web app!  

The interface works by sending that wireless data over a Serial connection, and using a Rust Script that creates Scan Reports to the Kismet API.
