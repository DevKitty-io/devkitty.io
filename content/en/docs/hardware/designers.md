## Features
DevKitty ships with a basic 3D-printed enclosure that protects the screen & other components from damage in transit.

The design is comprised of 4 parts:   
1. [Faceplate]()
2. [Backplate]()
3. [D-Pad]()
4. [Bumper]()


The design snap fits together with 3 bevels and 2 relief points.  You'll notice the PCB contains screw stand-offs from older designs that used threaded inserts.

The 3D printed `Bumper Button` interfaces with the `Boot Button` / `0 Button` on the S2 mini - which is necessary to toggle if you're reflashing your firmware.

## Case Evolution
As much as we'd love to openly display our beautiful circuit board art, the screens fractured easily when shipping earlier DevKitty boards.  This called for a fully encapsulated enclosure!   

A couple iterations later, we ended up with a chonky console-like design that can be easily 3D printed!

The most recent `v3.1` boards were shipped with updated cases that allow you to toggle the `Boot Button` without having to remove the enclosure.
