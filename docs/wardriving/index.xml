It&amp;rsquo;s one of the quickest ways to gather intelligence on large amounts of WiFi networks and smart devices!
By combining wireless &amp;amp; GPS data, you can create maps that let you easily locate where vulnerable networks were spotted.
Use Cases # You can use WiFi reconaissance &amp;amp; wardriving for hunting down lost devices, creating interesting visualizations, and so much more!</description></item><item><title>Hardware</title><link>/docs/wardriving/hardware/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>/docs/wardriving/hardware/</guid><description>What You Need # Wardriving combines wireless reconnaissance &amp;amp; location data - since DevKitty boards are already capable of sniffing WiFi &amp;amp; Bluetooth, this means all you need is a GPS module!
MicroSD Card GPS Module Battery Pack (optional) Official Hardware # For v0 DevKitty boards, our UART expansion header makes it easy to plug-and-play GPS modules without any fuss! You can buy one here.
GPS Modules # The Wardriver Firmware should work with any UART GPS module!</description></item><item><title>Firmware</title><link>/docs/wardriving/devkitty-wardriver/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>/docs/wardriving/devkitty-wardriver/</guid><description>Wardriver Firmware # The DevKitty Wardriver Firmware logs data to the onboard MicroSD card so you can easily map WiFi devices &amp;amp; visualize data! Currently supports CutieCat &amp;amp; older Nugget boards!
Features # This project is currently in alpha release so features will be changing heavily. the DevKitty Wardriver currently works best as a WiGLE companion!

When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to take your wardriving skills to the next level, we recommend trying out this project.
This is an example of Kismet in action in one of Alex&amp;rsquo;s old videos!
