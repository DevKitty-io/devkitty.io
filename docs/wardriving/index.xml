It&amp;rsquo;s one of the quickest ways to gather intelligence on large amounts of WiFi networks and devices!
Typically, all you need is a WiFi &amp;amp; GPS enabled device (like a smartphone), but you can get started for as cheap as $10 using microcontrollers. We&amp;rsquo;re basically just &amp;ldquo;geotagging&amp;rdquo; the wireless devices, so we can locate them later on.</description></item><item><title>DevKitty Wardriver</title><link>/docs/wardriving/devkitty-wardriver/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>/docs/wardriving/devkitty-wardriver/</guid><description>Features # This project is currently in alpha release so features will be changing heavily. the DevKitty Wardriver currently works best as a WiGLE companion!
Built-In Flash Drive (for logs) SD Card Support Promiscuous WiFi Scanning WiGLE.net compatible logs Cats! Hardware # This should work for any UART GPS module. We recommend using one of the following! The ATGM336H is our favorite for its small footprint.
