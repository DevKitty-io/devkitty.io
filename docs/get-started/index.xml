Your feedback &amp; suggestions are cherished. What is the CutieCat? # CutieCat is your new hacking &amp;amp; prototyping companion! It&amp;rsquo;s a cat-shaped console that lets you experiment with USB Attacks, Wireless Hacking, and fun mini-projects in CircuitPython.
Our CutieCat add-ons will get you building prototypes in no time!
